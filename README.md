Usage: singularity-import-boost [options]

A tool to automatically import deals to boost

Options:
  -c, --client <addresses...>                    List of client addresses to filter the deal proposals
  -p, --path <paths...>                          List of paths to find the CAR files
  -s, --since <duration>                         Import deals that are proposed since this many seconds old and skip those that are older (default: "1d")
  -sd, --sealing-duration <duration>             Import deals whose start time is more than this many seconds in the future to account for time spent for sealing. Otherwise, sealing will fail if it does not finish before the start time of the deal (default: "6h")
  -u, --url-template <template>                  The URL template to download CAR files, if it cannot be found from the specified paths. i.e. https://www.download.org/{dataCid}.car, https://www.download.org/{pieceCid}.car
  -dt, --download-threads <threads>              The number of concurrent threads for downloading (default: 8)
  -dr, --download-retries <retries>              The number of exponential retries for each download (default: 3)
  -o, --download-folder <folder>                 The folder to save the downloaded CAR files
  -i, --interval <duration>                      The interval in seconds between handling applicable deals, including both file downloads and deal importing. The timer starts when the previous import begins so it is possible to have concurrent imports or downloads if the interval is too small, which is probably fine with boost. (default: "1m")
  -dc, --download-concurrency <concurrency>      This sets an upper limit of concurrent downloads (default: 1)
  -pc, --max-pc1 <max_pc1>                       The maximum number of PC1s to run concurrently, once reached, stop importing or downloading new deals. 0 for unlimited. [Hack] For 64G miner, this value needs to be doubled. (default: 0)
  -ppc, --max-potential-pc1 <max_potential_pc1>  The maximum number of potential PC1s to run concurrently, the difference between this and --max-pc1 is, this includes all deals that will become PC1 shortly, including AP, deals pending publishing and being published. [Hack] For 64G miner, this value needs to be doubled. (default: 0)
  -vc, --pending-commp <max_commp>               The maximum number of deals waiting in the Verifying Commp State (default: 0)
  -r, --reverse                                  Import deals in reverse order, i.e. from the oldest to the newest (default: false)
  -d, --dry-run                                  Do not import deals, just print the deals that would be imported or downloaded (default: false)
  -l, --loop                                     Keep monitoring the incoming deals and perform the import indefinitely (default: false)
  -h, --help                                     display help for command


Environment Variables:
  Make sure you have one of the following environment variables set:
    - MARKETS_API_INFO, i.e. eyJxxx:/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/1289/http
    - BOOST_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT, i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8080

Example Usage:
  - Import all deals continuously one after another:
    $ singularity-import-boost -p /path/to/car -i 0 -l
  - Import one deal every 20 minutes with multiple paths
    $ singularity-import-boost -p /path1/to/car -p /path2/to/car -i 20m -l
  - Import deals from a specific client and the file can be downloaded from their HTTP server.
    $ singularity-import-boost -c f1xxxx -u https://www.download.org/{pieceCid}.car -o ./downloads -i 0 -l

```
